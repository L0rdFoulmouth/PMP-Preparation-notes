**Predictive (Waterfall) Project Management**
**Definition**: Predictive project management, often referred to as the waterfall approach, is a linear and sequential method where each phase of the project must be completed before the next phase begins.
**Characteristics**:
1. **Fixed Scope**: The project scope, schedule, and cost are determined early in the project life cycle and are strictly followed.
1. **Phase Sequence**: Each phase (initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, and closing) must be completed before the next phase starts.
1. **Detailed Planning**: Extensive planning is done upfront, and changes are managed through formal change control processes.
1. **Risk Management**: Risks are identified and managed through predefined plans.
**Advantages**:
* Clear structure and documentation.
* Easy to manage and track progress.
* Well-suited for projects with stable requirements.
**Disadvantages**:
* Inflexible to changes.
* Can be slow to adapt to new information.
* Risk of delivering a product that may no longer meet stakeholder needs due to changes in requirements over time.

**Adaptive (Agile) Project Management**
**Definition**: Agile project management is an iterative and incremental approach that focuses on delivering small, usable segments of the project to the customer for feedback and continuous improvement.
**Characteristics**:
1. **Iterative Development**: The project is divided into small cycles called iterations or sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks.
1. **Incremental Deliverables**: Working products are delivered frequently, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustments.
1. **Flexibility**: The approach is highly adaptable to changes, with an emphasis on responding to customer feedback and changing requirements.
1. **Collaboration**: Agile promotes close collaboration between the project team and stakeholders.
**Advantages**:
* High adaptability to changes.
* Continuous delivery of value to the customer.
* Encourages stakeholder engagement and satisfaction.
**Disadvantages**:
* Can be challenging to manage without experienced teams.
* Requires continuous stakeholder involvement.
* May lead to scope creep if not properly managed.
**Key Concepts in Agile**
1. **Agile Manifesto**:
	* **Values**
		* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools –people > process/tools
		* Working software over comprehensive documentation –it works > documentation
		* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation –collaboration > contract
		* Responding to change over following a plan –adaptability > plans.
	* **Principles**
		* Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery
		* Welcome changing requirements
		* Deliver working software frequently
		* Work together daily with business people and developers
		* Build projects around motivated individuals
		* Face-to-face conversation is the best way to convey information
		* Working software is the primary measure of progress
		* Maintain a constant pace indefinitely
		* Continuous attention to technical excellence
		* Simplicity is essential
		* The best architectures and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
		* Regularly reflect and adjust to become more effective
1. **Scrum Framework**
* **Roles**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
* **Artifacts**: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment
* **Events**: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective
* **Kanban**: Visualization tool that uses a board to manage workflow and limit work in progress (WIP)
* **Extreme Programming (XP)**: Emphasizes customer satisfaction and focuses on delivering software frequently and consistently with high-quality standards

**Comparison and Use Cases**
**When to Use Predictive Approach**:
* Projects with well-defined requirements and scope.
* Low uncertainty and risk.
* Stakeholders need a clear, linear plan.
**When to Use Agile Approach**:
* Projects with high uncertainty and changing requirements.
* Need for frequent stakeholder feedback.
* Emphasis on rapid delivery of usable products.
**Hybrid Approach**:
* Combines elements of both predictive and agile approaches.
* Suitable for projects where some aspects are well-defined, while others require flexibility.
**Specific Techniques**:
* **Rolling Wave Planning**: Progressive elaboration where detailed planning is done for the near term, and broader planning is done for the future.
* Plan as you go, what happens gets rolled into the next plan.
* **Time-Boxing**: Allocates a fixed time period for activities, common in agile methods like Scrum.
* **Steel thread**: E2E validation
