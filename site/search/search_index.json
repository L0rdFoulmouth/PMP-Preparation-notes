Characteristics : 1. Fixed Scope : The project scope, schedule, and cost are determined early in the project life cycle and are strictly followed. 1. Phase Sequence : Each phase (initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, and closing) must be completed before the next phase starts. 1. Detailed Planning : Extensive planning is done upfront, and changes are managed through formal change control processes. 1. Risk Management : Risks are identified and managed through predefined plans. Advantages : * Clear structure and documentation. * Easy to manage and track progress. * Well-suited for projects with stable requirements. Disadvantages : * Inflexible to changes. * Can be slow to adapt to new information. * Risk of delivering a product that may no longer meet stakeholder needs due to changes in requirements over time. Adaptive (Agile) Project Management Definition : Agile project management is an iterative and incremental approach that focuses on delivering small, usable segments of the project to the customer for feedback and continuous improvement. Characteristics : 1. Iterative Development : The project is divided into small cycles called iterations or sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. 1. Incremental Deliverables : Working products are delivered frequently, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustments. 1. Flexibility : The approach is highly adaptable to changes, with an emphasis on responding to customer feedback and changing requirements. 1. Collaboration : Agile promotes close collaboration between the project team and stakeholders. Advantages : * High adaptability to changes. * Continuous delivery of value to the customer. * Encourages stakeholder engagement and satisfaction. Disadvantages : * Can be challenging to manage without experienced teams. * Requires continuous stakeholder involvement. * May lead to scope creep if not properly managed. Key Concepts in Agile 1. Agile Manifesto : * Values * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools \u2013people > process/tools * Working software over comprehensive documentation \u2013it works > documentation * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation \u2013collaboration > contract * Responding to change over following a plan \u2013adaptability > plans. * Principles * Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery * Welcome changing requirements * Deliver working software frequently * Work together daily with business people and developers * Build projects around motivated individuals * Face-to-face conversation is the best way to convey information * Working software is the primary measure of progress * Maintain a constant pace indefinitely * Continuous attention to technical excellence * Simplicity is essential * The best architectures and designs emerge from self-organizing teams * Regularly reflect and adjust to become more effective 1. Scrum Framework * Roles : Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team * Artifacts : Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment * Events : Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective * Kanban : Visualization tool that uses a board to manage workflow and limit work in progress (WIP) * Extreme Programming (XP) : Emphasizes customer satisfaction and focuses on delivering software frequently and consistently with high-quality standards Comparison and Use Cases When to Use Predictive Approach : * Projects with well-defined requirements and scope. * Low uncertainty and risk. * Stakeholders need a clear, linear plan. When to Use Agile Approach : * Projects with high uncertainty and changing requirements. * Need for frequent stakeholder feedback. * Emphasis on rapid delivery of usable products. Hybrid Approach : * Combines elements of both predictive and agile approaches. * Suitable for projects where some aspects are well-defined, while others require flexibility. Specific Techniques : * Rolling Wave Planning : Progressive elaboration where detailed planning is done for the near term, and broader planning is done for the future. * Plan as you go, what happens gets rolled into the next plan. * Time-Boxing : Allocates a fixed time period for activities, common in agile methods like Scrum. * Steel thread : E2E validation","title":"Types of Projectsmd"},{"location":"Types_of_leaders/","text":"Coercers Tell team members what to do and how to do Rarely listen and often seek little input from the team Micro-manager Never provide any type of reward and tend to give more negative feedback than positive feedback Have high standards Inflexible work environment Authoritarian Firm, but fair Tactful in providing clear directions but leave no doubt about what is expected Frequently solicit input from the team Explain the WHYs but always make final decision High standards as well as high clariity Affiliator People first Team member's comfort and happiness and their own personal popularity is the highest priority Do not provide clear directions Try to avoid conflicts No accountability Democrat Group participation and team based decision making Rewards average performance and rarely give negative feedbacks Do not hold team accountable for bad behaviour Pacesetter Would rather do the job themselves Loners Expect team to be self-directed Do not spend time mentoring rarely provide positive feedback Coach Primarily concerned with development of the project team Generally set high standard and work with the team to set those standards","title":"Types of Leadership"}]}
